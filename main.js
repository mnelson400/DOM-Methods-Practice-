// Assessment: DOM Methods Practice


// Challenge:

// 1. Your first task is to use DOM methods to re-create 
//  the DOM tree below using only JavaScript.

// 2. Now, add a "click" event listener to the button element 
//  you created. On click, remove the <main> element node from 
//  the page. After clicking this button, the user should only 
//  see the button on the page and the DOM tree should look like this:





// Stretch Goals:

// 1. Stretch Goal: Add a text input and a button which, on click, can 
//  REMOVE an element based on a CSS selector provided by the user in the textbox.

//  2. Stretch Goal: Add a text input and a button which, on click, can CREATE 
//  an element and append it to the page. This element should contain text 
//  content provided by the user in the textbox.
